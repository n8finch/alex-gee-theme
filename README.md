1. Upload the Genesis Framework to your site, but don't activate it.
2. Clone or download the zip of this project to your themes directory.
3. In terminal, navigate to this theme's directory.
4. Run `npm install` to get bourbon, neat, and grunt components.
5. Then run `grunt sass` to create your style.css file and style.css.map
6. In the wp-admin go to Apperance>>Themes, and activate this child theme.

You should be ready to go.

If you want to develop more on this theme, run grunt to add `browserSync` to the mix!

If you don't see the child theme, or it says the stylesheet is missing, make sure you've run `npm install` and `grunt` correctly.
